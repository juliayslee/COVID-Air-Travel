# COVID19_Travel_Analysis
Due to the increase in COVID-19 cases, I wanted to take a look at the data and if there was a correlation to the increase in air travel. This was out of pure curiousity, I do not imply causation. 

Over the week there was a reported 130% surge in air travel from May 2020 to June 2020. Along with an increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases, I asked if there could be any correlation? Or was this another case of news outlets reporting misleading statistics. The notebook will go through some analysis along with a visual made from [datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/)


Data is provided by [TSA](https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput) and [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/united-states?country=~USA). Data scraping, preparation and analysis all in Jupyter Notebooks for now.

Data parsing from TSA webpage was heavily based on the code from [this Medium post by Syed Sadat Nazrul](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-html-tables-with-python-c9baba21059)
